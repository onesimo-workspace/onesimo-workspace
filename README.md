# Technical Portfolio — ICT Applications Development

## Overview

This repository is a structured portfolio of my work as an ICT Applications Development student at the Durban University of Technology (DUT).
It focuses on building dependable, well-documented software systems designed for practical operational and business environments.

Rather than producing isolated coding exercises, the work here emphasizes:

* Translating real-world problems into structured software solutions
* Maintainability, traceability, and clarity of design
* Documentation alongside implementation
* Incremental improvement of systems over time

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a technical archive:

```
personal-projects/        → Independent systems built to address real problems
ai-prompted-projects/     → Projects demonstrating controlled, transparent AI usage
school-projects/          → Reworked academic work presented as professional case studies
ai-agents/                → Narrow, task-focused decision-support tools
experiments-and-labs/     → Learning space for testing ideas and technologies
docs-and-standards/       → Development standards, templates, and workflow practices
```

Each primary project includes:

* A clearly defined problem statement
* System design explanation
* Implementation details
* Documentation of decisions and trade-offs

## Development Philosophy

* Quality over quantity
* Systems over isolated features
* Clear reasoning over unnecessary complexity
* Software built for real use rather than demonstration
